# China's Recent Bans and Restrictions (2024-2025)

## Overview
China has implemented several significant bans and restrictions across various sectors in 2024-2025, primarily focusing on technology exports, AI regulation, and strategic materials. These measures reflect China's efforts to protect national security, maintain technological advantages, and regulate emerging technologies.

## Technology Export Restrictions

### Battery Technology Exports (July 2025)
**What:** China restricted exports of 8 key electric vehicle (EV) battery technologies
**When:** July 15, 2025 (effective immediately)
**Details:**
- **Battery cathode technologies:** Lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP), and other phosphate-based precursors
- **Lithium extraction technologies:** 5 technologies related to lithium extraction and processing
- **Gallium extraction:** Ion exchange and resin techniques for gallium metal extraction
- **Impact:** Manufacturers must obtain government licenses before transferring these technologies abroad
- **Rationale:** Protect China's dominance in the global EV supply chain and safeguard strategic technologies

### Germline Gene Editing Ban (July 2024)
**What:** Complete ban on clinical research involving germline genome editing
**When:** July 13, 2024
**Details:**
- Prohibits altering DNA in sperm, eggs, or early embryos for heritable changes
- Bans use of genome editing on germ cells, fertilized eggs, or human embryos for reproductive purposes
- Response to the 2018 He Jiankui gene-edited babies controversy
- Requires "broad social consensus" and "rigorous evaluation" before any future consideration

## AI and Technology Regulation

### School AI Restrictions (May 2025)
**What:** Restrictions on children's use of generative AI in schools
**When:** May 2025
**Details:**
- **Primary school students:** Prohibited from using unrestricted generative AI tools independently
- **Middle school students:** Can explore how AI reasons and analyzes information
- **High school students:** Allowed broader use of AI technology
- **General restrictions:** Students banned from directly copying AI-generated content into homework
- **Requirements:** Schools must establish approved AI tool lists

### Generative AI Services Regulation (August 2023)
**What:** Comprehensive regulation of public-facing generative AI services
**When:** August 15, 2023 (still in effect)
**Details:**
- Requires AI services to adhere to "Core Socialist Values"
- Prohibits content that undermines socialist system or national security
- Mandates labeling of AI-generated content
- Requires user consent for personal data use in training
- Establishes complaint mechanisms and regulatory oversight

## Chemical and Hazardous Materials

### Beijing Hazardous Chemicals (2024)
**What:** Updated bans and restrictions on hazardous chemicals in Beijing
**When:** April 1, 2024
**Details:**
- Bans on 62 specific chemicals
- Regional restrictions on certain chemicals
- Based on national safety regulations
- Affects industrial and commercial use

## International Technology Access

### OpenAI Access Block (July 2024)
**What:** OpenAI blocked Chinese developers from accessing its services
**When:** July 9, 2024
**Details:**
- US-initiated block, not Chinese ban
- Affects API access for Chinese developers
- Prompted Chinese AI companies to offer migration services
- Led to increased adoption of domestic AI alternatives like Baidu's Ernie, SenseTime, and Zhipu AI

## US Restrictions on Chinese Technology

### Connected Vehicle Ban (January 2025)
**What:** US banned Chinese connected vehicles and robotaxi testing
**When:** January 14, 2025
**Details:**
- Software bans effective 2027 model year
- Hardware prohibitions in 2029
- Affects Chinese companies like WeRide and Pony AI
- Exempts vehicles over 10,000 pounds (allows BYD buses)

## Strategic Implications

### Technology Export Controls
China's recent restrictions reflect a strategic approach to:
- **Protect technological advantages** in key sectors like batteries and AI
- **Maintain supply chain dominance** in critical technologies
- **Respond to international tensions** and export controls from other countries
- **Balance innovation with security** concerns

### Regulatory Patterns
Common themes in China's recent bans include:
- **National security justifications** for technology restrictions
- **Graduated approaches** (licensing vs. complete bans)
- **Sector-specific regulations** tailored to different industries
- **Response to international pressure** and competitive dynamics

## Key Sectors Affected
1. **Electric Vehicle Technology** - Battery cathode materials and lithium processing
2. **Artificial Intelligence** - Generative AI services and educational use
3. **Biotechnology** - Gene editing research and clinical applications
4. **Chemical Industry** - Hazardous materials and industrial chemicals
5. **Automotive** - Connected vehicles and autonomous driving technology

## Sources and Timeline
- **July 2025:** Battery technology export restrictions
- **May 2025:** School AI usage restrictions
- **January 2025:** US connected vehicle ban (affecting Chinese companies)
- **July 2024:** Germline gene editing ban, OpenAI access block
- **April 2024:** Beijing hazardous chemicals restrictions
- **August 2023:** Generative AI services regulation (ongoing)
